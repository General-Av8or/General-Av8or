- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @General-Av8or
- ðŸ‘€ Check out my YouTube channel: youtube.com/@general_av8or?sub_confirmation=1 where I post Digital Combat Simulator World content with my VR!
- ðŸŽž  I work on DCS missions and starting to learn scripting to make better missions for my subscribers to enjoy.
- âœˆ  I will post the DCS missions here and hopefully be able to contribute by uploading scripts for DCS missions!
